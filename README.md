# Power BI Sales Dashboard - AdventureWorks Project

Interactive sales performance dashboard built from scratch as part of the Maven Analytics "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

- Star schema data modeling (relationships, hierarchies)
- Advanced DAX: CALCULATE, iterators (SUMX etc.), explicit measures/columns, time intelligence (YoY/MoM/YTD)
- Custom visualizations (maps, gauges, tables with conditional formatting)
- Interactivity (slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks)
- Numeric & field parameters (what-if analysis, dynamic measure switching)
- Calculation groups for optimized reporting
